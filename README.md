## Project Overview

STOAT-NODE is a specialized tool developed for conducting Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) with a unique focus on node within pangenome graphs. Unlike traditional GWAS tools that analyze linear genome variants, STOAT processes VCF files to extract and analyze node regions—complex structural variations that capture nested and overlapping variant patterns within a pangenome. This approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of genetic variations in diverse populations and complex traits.

STOAT supports both binary and quantitative phenotypes:

- For binary phenotypes (e.g., case vs control studies), it utilizes chi-squared tests and Fisher’s exact test to evaluate associations between phenotype groups and variants, providing robust statistical validation even in cases of sparse data.

- For quantitative phenotypes (e.g., traits measured on a continuous scale), the tool employs linear regression models to assess the association between node and phenotype values, allowing for continuous trait mapping with greater precision.

## Installation

````bash
git clone https://github.com/Plogeur/STOAT.git
cd STOAT
pip install .
````

## Dependencies
- Python version 3.10
- cyvcf2
- numpy
- pandas
- bdsg
- ...

## Input format file

Required files :
- pg : Pangenome graph file, formats accepted: .pg or .xg.
- dist : Distance file generated with vg dist, format: .dist.
- vcf : Merged VCF file, created using bcftools merge, formats: .vcf or .vcf.gz. (ex : `bcftools merge -m none -Oz -o test`)
- phenotype : phenotype file organise in three-column with FID (family/sample name), IID (sample name), and PHENO (integer/float). Format: .txt or .tsv (tab-separated).

Optional file : 
- paths : Two-column file containing snarl names and the list of paths through the snarl's netgraph, separated by tabs. Format: .txt or .tsv.
- ref : VCF referenting chromosomes and positions in the pangenome graph generated with vg deconstruct, formats: .vcf (only).

## Usage

Use `stoat tool` if you want to launch the full tool at once, starting from snarl path identification (identifying the multiple paths that can be taken by a sample based on the pangenome graph) and ending with the results plots (Manhattan plot and QQ plot).

- Run full tool :
```bash
# binary trait
stoat -p <pg.pg> -d <dist.dist> -v <vcf.vcf.gz> -b <phenotype.txt> -o output

# quantative trait
stoat -p <pg.pg> -d <dist.dist> -v <vcf.vcf.gz> -q <phenotype.txt> -o output
```

Explanation of all options:
```bash 
-p           Path to the input pangenome `.pg` file (mutually exclusive, required if `-l` not provided).
-d           Path to the input distance index `.dist` file (mutually exclusive, required if `-l` not provided).
-t           Specifies the children threshold (optional).
-v           Path to the merged VCF file (`.vcf` or `.vcf.gz`) (required).
-r           Path to the VCF file referencing all snarl positions (`.vcf` or `.vcf.gz`) (mutually exclusive, required if `-p and -d` not provided).
-l, --listpath  
             Path to the list of paths file (optional).
-b, --binary  
             Path to the binary group file (`.txt` or `.tsv`) (mutually exclusive, required if `-q` not provided).
-q, --quantitative  
             Path to the quantitative phenotype file (`.txt` or `.tsv`) (mutually exclusive, required if `-b` not provided).
-c, --covariate  (working progress)
             Path to the covariate file (`.txt` or `.tsv`), LMM analysis (optional).
-g, --gaf    
             Prepare binary GWAS output for a GAF file and create a GAF file with the top 10 significant paths (optional).
-o, --output  
             Specifies the base path for the output directory (optional).
```

Alternatively, you can specify the script you want to launch, depending on your desired task:

- **`list_snarl_paths.py`**: Identifies snarl paths. (By default, it excludes snarls with more than 50 children or 2 second computation by snarl)  
  **Input**: Graph information files (`.dist` and `.pg`)  
  **Output**: A two-column string file (`.tsv`) containing the snarl reference and the corresponding list of paths.

- **`children_distribution.py`**: An optional script to help decide the thresholds for `list_snarl_paths.py` based on the children distribution in the netgraph (pangenome graph).  
  **Input**: Graph information files (`.dist` and `.pg`)  
  **Output**: None

- **`snarl_analyser.py`**: The main script. It parses and analyzes all input files to return p-value associations.  
  **Input**:  
  - Snarl list paths (`.tsv` or `.txt`)  
  - Binary or quantitative phenotype (`.tsv` or `.txt`)  
  - Merged VCF (`.vcf.gz` or `.vcf`)  
  **Output**: P-value associations.

- **`gaf_creator.py`**: Creates a GAF file from a list of binary p-value associations (output of `snarl_analyser.py`).  
  **Input**: Binary p-value association file.  
  **Output**: GAF file.

- **`p_value_analysis.py`**: Creates a Manhattan plot and QQ plot (output of `snarl_analyser.py`).  
  **Input**: Binary or Quantitative p-value association file.  
  **Output**: 2 PNG file plots.

- Example of specific script of tool : 

```bash
# decompose pangenome
python3 stoat/list_snarl_paths.py -p <pg.pg> -d <dist.dist> -o <paths.txt>

# binary trait with list_path already computed and gaf creation 
stoat -l <paths.txt> -v <vcf.vcf.gz> -r <ref.vcf.gz> -b <phenotype.txt> --gaf -o output.tsv

# quantitative trait with list_path already computed
stoat -l <paths.txt> -v <vcf.vcf.gz> -r <ref.vcf.gz> -q <phenotype.txt> -o output.tsv
```
